<p>The following should be entered:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Provisions which are mentioned as being controlled, restricted discretionary, discretionary, or non-complying activites.</li>
<li>Performance standards that are mentioned as being breached (or not met). This may be explicit or the standard could be outlined as a minimum/maximum requirement with the activity's result also outlined (e.g. 'There is a minimum of two carparks required. The activity proposes to provide one carpark').</li>
</ul>
Some provisions may be discussed in the decision report at a finer level of detail than the survey drop-down options. For instance, if Rule 6.6.1.2 is breached but the drop-down box only includes Rule 6.6.1, then the available option (6.6.1) should be used.

The following should not be entered: 
<ul>
<li>Provisions that are mentioned as being permitted activities.</li>
<li>Performance standards which are mentioned as being met.</li>
<li>Any matters of discretion.</li>
</ul>
If a provision is mentioned but not included in the drop-down list, then it does not need to be entered.
